Meteor Blaze Components
=======================

Blaze Components for [Meteor](https://meteor.com/) are a system for easily developing complex UI elements
that need to be reused around your Meteor app.

* [meteor-template-extension](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-template-extension) – provides various ways of copying
template helpers, event handlers and hooks between templates, allowing code reuse; a downside is that all copying
has to be taken care by a developer, often again and again, which becomes problematic as codebase grows; moreover,
without a clearly defined API community cannot build and share components
* [meteor-autoform](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform) – offers forms components through a sophisticated
use of templates and template helpers but it is still hard to compose behaviors you want beyond defining additional
input fields
